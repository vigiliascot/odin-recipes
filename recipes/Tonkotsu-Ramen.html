    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Made with an intensely porky, opaque pale broth with a sticky-lipped intensity and the rich, 
        buttery texture of light cream, there's no smell more warming on a cold day than a big hot 
        bowl of tonkotsu ramen set before you. The best sports tiny nubbins of fat swimming around 
        on their surface, a slick of mayu (black garlic oil) or chile-sesame paste, a handful of 
        thin-sliced green onions, a soft-yolked soy-sauce tinged egg, and a few slices of meltingly 
        tender chashu pork belly.</p>
    <p>
        It's the ultimate meal-in-a-bowl and what any Japanese businessperson—and a good deal of 
        Americans these days—thinks of the moment you mention comfort food.
    </p>  

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds pig trotters</li>
        <li>2 pounds chicken backs and carcasses</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion,</li>
        <li>12 garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pork and chicken bones in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Place on a burner over high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from heat as soon as boil is reached.</li>
        <li>While pot is heating, heat vegetable oil in a medium cast iron or non-stick skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook, tossing occasionally until deeply charred on most sides, about 15 minutes total. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Once pot has come to a boil, dump water down the drain. Carefully wash all bones under cold running water, removing any bits of dark marrow or coagulated blood. Bones should be uniform grey/white after you've scrubbed them. Use a chopstick to help remove small bits of dark marrow from inside the trotters or near the chicken's spines.</li>
        <li>Return bones to pot along with charred vegetables, leeks, scallion whites, mushrooms, and pork fatback. Top up with cold water. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat, skimming off any scum that appears. (This should stop appearing within the first 20 minutes or so.) Use a clean sponge or moist paper towels to wipe any black or gray scum off from around the rim of the pot. Reduce heat to a bare simmer and place a heavy lid on top.</li>
        <li>Once the lid is on, check the pot after 15 minutes. It should be at a slow rolling boil. If not, increase or decrease heat slightly to adjust boiling speed. Boil broth until pork fatback is completely tender, about 4 hours. Carefully remove pork fat with a slotted spatula. Transfer fatback to a sealed container and refrigerate until step 7. Return lid to pot and continue cooking until broth is opaque with the texture of light cream, about 6 to 8 hours longer, topping up as necessary to keep bones submerged at all times. If you must leave the pot unattended for an extended period of time, top up the pot and reduce the heat to the lowest setting while you are gone. Return to a boil when you come back and continue cooking, topping up with more water as necessary.</li>
    </ol>
